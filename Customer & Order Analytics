#In this SQL, I am going to be quantifying and analyzing customers orders between multiple data tables.

#1 How many order were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2 How many of these orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT (orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length (orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM JanSales
ORDER BY price asc LIMIT 1;

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, Product, quantity, location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
